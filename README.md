# graph-pathfinding-algorithms
Cost Finding Algorithms for Graphs such as Shortest Path Algorithms (BellmanFord, Dijkstra, Floyd) and Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms (Kruskal, Prims).

# Edits Done to this project include:
1- Changed the aim of the path findings algorithms, from traversing to finding a goal node.
2- Evaluated each algorithms By displaying the path of visited nodes, the operation count, and the time it took to find the shortest path.
3- Displayed the graph with the path from the start to the goal node that the algorithm choose colored in red.

# How to launch the project:
1- unzip the folder.
2- open it in VScode.
3- select the input file (there are input10.txt is a graph with 10 nodes and input100.txt is one with 100 nodes and so on)
4- edit the goal node accordingly.
5- run the main.py file.
6- choose the selected input file.
7- select the algorithm you want.
